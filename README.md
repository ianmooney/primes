### Objective

Write a program that prints out a multiplication table of the first 10 prime numbers.
The program must run from the command line and print to screen 1 table.
Across the top and down the left side should be the 10 primes, and the body of the table should contain the product of multiplying these numbers.
The prime numbers should be calculated, rather than hardwired using Ruby's Prime Method.
Please include Rspec tests if possible.

### To run script

  cd primes/

  ./run.rb

#### To print different amount of prime numbers

  ./run.rb [NUM PRIMES]

  e.g.

  ./run.rb 15
